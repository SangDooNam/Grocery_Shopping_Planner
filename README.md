# Grocery Shopping Planner

### Purpose:

 **1. This application is designed for individuals living alone or with a partner, aiming to assist them in creating meal plans. Personally, I often prepare weekly meal plans and have automated this process using Python and Django.**

**2. This is my first application created using Python and Django. Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of both Python and Django. Additionally, I learned HTML and CSS, creating all the pages from scratch without relying on any templates.**

* Initially, users start with no recipes. However, by selecting options like breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they can create recipes. Once a recipe is created, it can be reused multiple times. This makes the process of creating a meal plan much quicker and more efficient once users have accumulated several recipes.
* On the right side, the table shows if a plan has already been created for the selected day and lists the chosen recipes.
